# Atmospheric instability during the El Niño and La Niña phenomena in Peru
This repository contains the replication package for the paper "Atmospheric instability during the El Niño and La Niña phenomena in Peru" (in progress).

## Content
- [download.R](/download.R). This script automates the download of daily radiosonde data for Jorge Chávez International Airport (station code: 84628) from 1973 to 2021. The data is sourced from the University of Wyoming.[^1]
- [indices.py](/indices.py). This script computes the five instability indices described in the paper: K-Index (KI), Total Totals Index (TT), Modified Showalter Index (MSI), Modified Lifted Index (MLI) and Gálvez-Davison Index (GDI).[^2]
- [analysis.R](/analysis.R). This script reproduces the core quantitative analysis from the paper, including:
  1. Management: cleans and prepares the initial dataset generated by [indices.py](/indices.py).
  2. Descriptive analysis: generates all descriptive summary tables reported in the paper.
  3. Graphs: creates all figures and graphs presented in the paper.
  4. Hypothesis test: executes the bootstrap procedure for comparing means and medians, as described in the methodology section.
       
Note: for any improvement suggestions you can send me an email to dffjs98@gmail.com.
